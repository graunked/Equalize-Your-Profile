Equalize Your Profile
==================================

This is a simple Facebook app that uses a ```<canvas>``` element to overlay an HRC-style equals sign on a users Facebook profile as a sign of support for marriage equality. The app was created in March 2013, while the US Supreme Court was hearing cases related to DOMA and Prop 8.
